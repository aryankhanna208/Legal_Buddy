In a deeply disturbing incident, two teachers from a government-run residential school in Nabarangpur district, Odisha, have been detained by the police on charges of gang-raping an 11-year-old female student in Class 5. The incident occurred on Tuesday within the premises of the school but came to light only after the survivor's father courageously filed a complaint on Thursday.

According to the father's complaint, his daughter, who is a day scholar at the school catering to SC and ST students, was lured by the accused teachers to the school's toilet, where the heinous crime took place during regular school hours. The police, upon receiving the complaint, acted swiftly, detaining the two accused teachers for their alleged involvement in this reprehensible act.

The community is now grappling with shock and outrage over this appalling incident, prompting discussions about the urgent need for enhanced child protection measures within educational institutions.
