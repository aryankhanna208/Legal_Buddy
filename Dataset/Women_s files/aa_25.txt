State of Uttar Pradesh v. Smt Aqueela, 1999 Cr LJ 2754.

Thus over the years various kinds of acid attacks have been registered under the sections related to hurt, grievous hurt, murder etc. However, the nature and effect of the crime of acid attack is very distinct and complex and the Sections relating to hurt and grievous hurt do not provide an adequate relief and punishment. Apart from this the police often use their discretion to decide what sections should be registered in the case of acid attacks and this discretion is at times influenced by gender bias and corruption or is a wrong assessment.

In most of the cases no compensation has been awarded. In those in which compensation has been awarded the sum is minimal and is totally inadequate to meet even the medical expenses. Normally courts just levy fines without even giving these to the victims. The section on Compensation in the CrPC should therefore clearly spell out that the fines levied should be given to the victim or their dependents.

The victims suffer a great deal due to a slow judicial process, inadequate compensation and obviously from the after affect of the acid attack itself.

Thus, there is an urgent need to legislate distinct sections in the I.P.C to deal with acid attacks and to setup a Criminal Injuries Compensation Board in India to deal with such cases in an effective and efficient manner, to help the victims of acid attack to get compensation for medical expenses and rehabilitation apart from making Section 357 CrPC mandatory in certain respects.
