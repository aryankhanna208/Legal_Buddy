Within the confines of the Jharkhand High Court, a case brought forth a nuanced legal interpretation surrounding an acid attack incident. Stationed at a Dhanbad bus stop, the victim faced the assailant who, armed with a photograph and driven by extortion, resorted to pouring acid on her. The resultant burn injuries to the eye, neck, and chest triggered charges under Sections 324, 326, and 307 IPC. The 2nd Additional Sessions Judge, Dhanbad, found the appellant guilty under Section 324 IPC, a decision upheld by the Hon'ble High Court. Strikingly, the victim was denied compensation, with the court's focus seemingly tethered to its assessment of the injuries, falling short of categorization as grievous hurt.
