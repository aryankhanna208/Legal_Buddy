Revinder Singh Vs. State of Harayana(AIR 1975 SC 856).

In a case before the Madras High Court,1 a person suspected his wife had developed an illicit relationship with one of his acquaintances. In that fit of anger he threw acid on her resulting in severe burns and death of the victim. The husband was convicted under Sec 302 IPC and 313 IPC (causing miscarriage of a woman without her consent) with life imprisonment and a fine of Rs. 2000. The fine was thus again a meager amount.
