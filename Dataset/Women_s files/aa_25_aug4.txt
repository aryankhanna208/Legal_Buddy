State of Uttar Pradesh v. Smt Aqueela, 1999 Cr LJ 2754.
Acid attacks have been documented under legal sections covering harm, grievous harm, and murder over the years. However, the distinct and complex nature of acid attack crimes surpasses the effectiveness of existing sections related to harm and grievous harm, leaving victims without sufficient relief and perpetrators without appropriate punishment. Additionally, the discretionary authority exercised by the police in selecting applicable sections introduces the risk of gender bias, corruption, or inaccurate judgments, further highlighting the need for legislative amendments.
