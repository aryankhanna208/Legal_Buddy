The matrimonial alliance between Rajesh Sharma (Appellant) and Sneha Sharma (Respondent), sealed on November 28th, 2012, takes a tumultuous turn with allegations of dowry harassment. Despite Sneha's father's best efforts in providing dowry, the Appellants allegedly engaged in harassment, pressuring for Rs. 3,00,000/- and a vehicle. The distressing saga intensifies with the Complainant's pregnancy ending abruptly, leading to her abandonment by the Appellant.

In response to the harrowing experiences, Sneha initiates legal proceedings, filing a lawsuit against the Appellant and his family. The crux of her claim lies in the alleged dowry demands during her pregnancy, coupled with torment inflicted by her spouse and his kin, resulting in the tragic termination of her pregnancy.

The legal narrative takes an intriguing turn as the Appellants, unsatisfied with the High Court's decision to uphold the summons, file an appeal in the Supreme Court. Their contention centers around an absence of intent to make dowry demands, adding a layer of complexity to this matrimonial imbroglio. As the Supreme Court prepares to weigh the intricacies of this case, it remains poised to unravel the truth behind the dowry allegations and the Appellants' vehement denial of any such intentions.
