Harassment cases in Pune's Koregaon Park leave women fighting for safe space
PUNE: As multiple women report attacks and sexual harassment on the streets, the city's reputation as a safe place for women is now being questioned.
The affluent neighbourhood of Koregaon Park is not far behind, as walking or travelling in the by-lanes has become a fight for survival.  
In another case, a restaurant owner was molested by two men on a scooter around 10pm on Wednesday when she was taking a walk with her husband; another woman had to ward off unwanted advances by a group of drunken men.
