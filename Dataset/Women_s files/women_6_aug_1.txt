The ordeal faced by Sweta Kiran, as narrated by her family, paints a harrowing picture of marital strife fueled by alleged dowry demands. The victim's family contends that the demands made by Arnesh Kumar's parents for a substantial sum, a car, and various electronic items demonstrate a blatant disregard for the sanctity of marriage and the emotional well-being of their daughter. This distressing situation not only violates the sacred bonds of matrimony but also exposes the victim to undue hardship and emotional trauma.

Sweta Kiran's family asserts that her eviction from the matrimonial home, as a consequence of not meeting the exorbitant dowry demands, is a grave injustice. It underscores the urgent need for legal intervention to protect the rights and dignity of married women. The victim's family argues that Arnesh Kumar's alignment with his parents in the face of such demands, coupled with the threat of marrying another woman, reflects a deeply troubling mindset that perpetuates the exploitation of women in the name of dowry.

The family firmly supports Sweta Kiran's pursuit of justice, as reflected in her legal actions against Arnesh Kumar. They argue that the dismissal of the anticipatory bail plea by both the Sessions Judge and the High Court is a crucial step toward ensuring accountability for the alleged crimes. The family hopes that the Supreme Court, through careful consideration of the Special Leave Petition, will uphold the principles of justice and equity.
