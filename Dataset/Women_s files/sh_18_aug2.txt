"While riding home on my two-wheeler with a friend, we noticed a group of men on motorbikes tailing us. Despite hearing them shout names, we hesitated to stop or turn around due to fear. I swiftly accelerated our two-wheeler, making a dash for the main road in the anticipation of reaching a more populated area before they could catch up. Thankfully, the men abandoned their pursuit once we hit the main road. It turned out to be one of the most terrifying rides we've had," she recounted.
