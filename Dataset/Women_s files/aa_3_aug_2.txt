In the legal saga of Revinder Singh vs. State of Haryana (AIR 1975 SC 856), the Supreme Court grappled with a harrowing incident presented before the Madras High Court. The accused, driven by suspicions of his wife's alleged involvement in an illicit relationship, unleashed a brutal act of violence by throwing acid on her. The ensuing severe burns proved fatal, leading to the victim's untimely demise.

The court, in its judgment, found the husband culpable under Section 302 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) for murder and Section 313 IPC for causing the miscarriage of a woman without her consent. The severity of the offenses warranted a life imprisonment sentence, accompanied by a financial penalty of Rs. 2000. However, concerns arose regarding the adequacy of the imposed fine, with some viewing it as disproportionately low given the egregious nature of the crime.

This case serves as a poignant reminder of the challenges in crafting legal remedies that address the nuances of gender-based violence and the imperative of ensuring that penalties align with the severity of the offenses committed.
