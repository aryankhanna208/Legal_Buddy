Actor-politician Suresh Gopi questioned by Kerala police in sexual harassment case
Malayalam film actor and former BJP Rajya Sabha MP Suresh Gopi on Wednesday turned up before the police in Keralaâ€™s Kozhikode, where he is facing a sexual harassment case following an interaction with journalists last month.

Hundreds of BJP workers, led by party state president K Surendran and several senior leaders, accompanied Gopi to the police station and waited outside as officials started questioning the actor.

On October 28, the Kozhikode city police had registered a case against Gopi under Section 354 A (sexual harassment of nature of unwelcome physical contact and explicit sexual overtures) based on a complaint from a journalist working with a TV channel.sh
