In the intricate tapestry of legal entanglements, the complainant, not tethered by the bonds of legal matrimony to the respondent, sought redress in the court's hallowed halls, clamoring for maintenance. The labyrinthine narrative further unfolds as the appellant, ensnared in the complexities of a live-in relationship, bore the fruits of a shared existenceâ€”a child. In the aftermath of their separation, the appellant, grappling with the challenges of single parenthood, beseeched the Gumla Family Court for financial solace from her estranged partner. The trial court, in its wisdom, acceded to her plea, decreeing a monthly alimony of Rs 2000 for the appellant and an additional Rs 1000 earmarked for the sustenance of the shared progeny.

Nevertheless, dissatisfied with the outcome, the appellant, wielding the sword of legal recourse, unsheathed an appeal before the High Court. In an unexpected turn of events, the High Court, wielding its judicial scepter, tilted the scales in favor of the respondent, disputing the family court's pronouncement. Undeterred and unwavering in her pursuit of justice, the appellant, like a legal crusader, marched forth to the Supreme Court. The apex court, as the ultimate arbiter of justice, now bears the solemn responsibility of unraveling the legal intricacies woven in this familial saga, where the threads of relationship, parenthood, and financial obligation intersect in the labyrinth of jurisprudential deliberation.
