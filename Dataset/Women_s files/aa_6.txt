 Smt. Bhagwan Kuar Vs Krishna Maharaja ( AIR 1973 SC 1346).

In Srimanthula Chinna Sathaiah and Anr. Vs. State of A.P, 1998 (4) ALD 18. enmity developed between two men. The accused was suspicious that the other person had falsely implicated him in a case. He also suspected that his wife was having an affair with the victim's elder son. As a revenge the accused threw acid on the victim, which resulted in severe acid burns on the face and body. The accused was charged under Section 302 and 34 of the IPC and was awarded rigorous imprisonment for life.

In some cases which are targeted against women dowry and property can be the reasons for acid attacks. Property and land disputes and sometimes revenge1 can prove to be a motive for acid attacks against men. It appears that the idea that acid is an easy effective method of harming and killing enemies can spread to general attacks against both women and men.
