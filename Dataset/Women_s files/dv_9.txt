In 1989, Kiranjit Ahluwalia, after enduring a decade of abuse from her husband, Deepak, reached a breaking point when he burned her face with a hot iron. Distraught, she retaliated by setting his feet on fire, aiming to inflict a lasting reminder of the pain she suffered. Despite not intending to kill him, Deepak succumbed to his injuries 10 days later. Kiranjit, convicted of murder, received a life sentence in December of that year.
