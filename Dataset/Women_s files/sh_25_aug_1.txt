On September 16, within the precincts of Sai Upvan city forest in Ghaziabad, a distressing incident unfolded as a 22-year-old woman and her fiance fell victim to alleged sexual harassment by two individuals in police attire and an unidentified civilian. The perpetrators, arriving in a Ghaziabad Police response vehicle, coerced the couple to surrender Rs 10,000 under threat. An official complaint lodged on September 28 at the Kotwali Nagar police station prompted the initiation of a formal investigation.
