the Complainant, who was not the Respondent’s legally wedded wife, approached the Court to obtain maintenance.

In this instance, the Appellant was in a live-in relationship, with whom she had a kid. When the couple got separated, the Appellant sought support from her spouse, for which the Gumla Family Court allowed, giving her Rs 2000 per month and Rs 1000 to her child. The Appellant filed an appeal in the High Court, which found the family court’s ruling to be incorrect and ruled in favour of the partner. The Appellant then went to the Supreme Court.
