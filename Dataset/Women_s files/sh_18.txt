"I was headed home on my two-wheeler with a friend when some men on motorbikes started following us. We heard them call out names but did not have the courage to stop or turn around. I accelerated my two-wheeler and raced to the main road, hoping to reach a populated area before they could catch up to us. The men stopped following us after we reached the main road. It was one of the scariest rides of our lives," she said.
