A 28-year-old man has been given life imprisonment by the Panipat court in a 2019 case of dowry death. A woman had hanged herself to death within 15 months of her marriage due to constant harassment over dowry.
The husband was held guilty while the in-laws were acquitted in the absence of evidence against them.
Public prosecutor Kuldeep Dhull said that on May 3, 2019, Neelam (26) died by hanging due to continuous harassment and torture by her husband and in-laws for dowry.
