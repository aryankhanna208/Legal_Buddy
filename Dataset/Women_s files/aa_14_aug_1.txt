In the case of Revinder Singh vs. State of Haryana (AIR 1975 SC 856), the Supreme Court addressed a situation where a husband suspected his wife of having an illicit relationship and, in a fit of rage, threw acid on her. The victim suffered severe burns, leading to her untimely death. The husband was subsequently convicted under Section 302 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) for murder and Section 313 IPC for causing the miscarriage of a woman without her consent. The court sentenced him to life imprisonment and imposed a fine of Rs. 2000. The relatively nominal fine raises questions about the adequacy of the penalty for such a heinous crime.
