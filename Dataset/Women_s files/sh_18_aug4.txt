"On my way home with a friend on our two-wheeler, we found ourselves being pursued by a group of men on motorcycles. Although we heard them shouting names, fear prevented us from stopping or looking back. I quickly increased the speed of our two-wheeler, racing towards the main road in the hope of reaching a crowded area before they could close in on us. Fortunately, the men ceased their pursuit once we reached the main road. It was undeniably one of the most frightening rides we've ever experienced," she recounted.
