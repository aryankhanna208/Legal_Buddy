Barati Vs. State of U.P.(AIR 1974 SC 839).

Many cases in which death doesn't occur get registered under the sections related to hurt and grievous hurt and not attempt to murder as no intention of killing or knowledge that the offence is likely to cause death is attributed to the accused.

In a case before the Jharkhand High Court1 the victim was standing with her friend at a Bus Stop in Dhanbad. The Appellant came and poured acid over her head and face.The appellant had a photograph of the victim and was blackmailing her but she refused to accede to his demands. The victim suffered burn injuries over the left side of her eye, neck and chest and had to be hospitalized. A case was registered under Sections 324, 326, 307 IPC.

The police investigated the case and finally submitted a chargesheet against the appellant under the aforesaid sections. The learned 2nd Additional Sessions Judge, Dhanbad held the appellant guilty under Section 324 IPC and convicted and sentenced him to undergo RI for three years. The appellant's conviction was upheld by the Hon'ble High Court. No compensation whatsoever was awarded to the victim. In this case the court seems to have been guided by the nature of injuries which in its opinion did not amount to grievous hurt
