In the other incident, in the TP Chathiram area, a Class VII student of a private school, who is a resident of Anna Nagar East, was walking back home from a tuition centre when she was groped by a man wearing a helmet. After sexually harassing her, the culprit escaped on his bike even as the girl screamed for help.
Police said the girl was near RV Nagar Fourth Street in TP Chathiram when the suspect, who had been standing on the roadside close to his bike, saw her. He walked towards the girl and groped her and then rode away. The traumatised minor then rushed back home and informed her parents. 
Based on her fatherâ€™s complaint, the TP Chathiram police registered a case and launched a hunt but are yet to trace and identify the suspect.
