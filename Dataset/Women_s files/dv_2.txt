A 55-year-old Indian businessman based in the US has been ordered by a sessions court to pay his ex-wife Rs 3 crore for domestic violence over 23 years. Additionally, he must pay Rs 1 crore for rent and maintenance. Despite earning Rs 20.50 lakh monthly, the court upheld the order, denying him relief. The woman filed a domestic violence case in 2017, citing harassment from their honeymoon onwards. The man, denying allegations, claimed the woman suffered medical issues, moved out on her own, and he filed for divorce and remarried after a decade-longÂ separation.
