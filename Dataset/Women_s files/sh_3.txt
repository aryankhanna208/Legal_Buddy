Karnataka seer walks out of jail after being in custody for over 1 year facing charges under POCSO Act

NEW DELHI/CHITRADURGA (KARNATAKA): Shivamurthy Sharana, the spiritual leader of the Chitradurga Murugharajendra Bruhan Math, who had been held in custody since September of last year on charges under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act, was released from jail on Thursday.
The high court had granted bail to the seer on November 8 in two cases related to the sexual assault of two high school girls. The release order was issued by the second additional district and sessions court in Chitradurga on Wednesday after examining the conditions imposed by the HC and verifying the documents but due to a delay in reaching the jail, the release process was completed on Thursday.

On Thursday morning, a plea filed by the government counsel on behalf of the prosecution sought to convert the body warrant issued against the seer in the second Pocso case into a judicial custody order, essentially seeking to stop his release from jail.

A case against the seer was registered on August 26, 2022, at Nazarabad police station in Mysuru for allegedly sexually assaulting two minor students under the Pocso Act and the SC/ST (Prevention of Atrocities) Act. The case was subsequently transferred to Chitradurga rural police station, leading to his arrest on September 1.
