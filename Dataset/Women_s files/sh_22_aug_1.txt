The Aluva child rape and murder case in Kerala took a disturbing turn as a local court revealed that the convict, 28-year-old Ashfaq Alam, had previously been accused of a similar crime in Delhi in 2018. The court noted that Alam, found guilty in the heinous act of raping and murdering a 5-year-old child in Aluva, had fled to Kerala, preventing the resolution of the Delhi case. The revelation underscores the urgency of addressing loopholes in tracking and preventing individuals accused of such crimes from evading justice and relocating to different regions.
