In instances where fatality is avoided, legal categorization becomes crucial, often leading to cases falling under sections related to hurt and grievous hurt rather than attempted murder. A recent case before the Jharkhand High Court1 sheds light on this legal intricacy.

At a Dhanbad Bus Stop, a victim, accompanied by her friend, became the target of a horrifying acid attack by an appellant. The assailant, armed with a photograph of the victim, resorted to blackmail, met with resistance, and subsequently unleashed acid on her head and face. The victim sustained severe burn injuries on her eye, neck, and chest, necessitating hospitalization. The police registered a case under Sections 324, 326, and 307 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC).

Following a thorough investigation, the police filed a chargesheet against the appellant under the aforementioned sections. The 2nd Additional Sessions Judge in Dhanbad found the appellant guilty under Section 324 IPC, sentencing him to three years of rigorous imprisonment. The Hon'ble High Court upheld the appellant's conviction, emphasizing the nature of injuries as a guiding factor. Notably, no compensation was awarded to the victim, sparking discussions about the intricacies of legal classifications in cases of grievous hurt.
