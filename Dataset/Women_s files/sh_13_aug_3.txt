During recent proceedings, Mr. Ansar Ahmad Chaudhary, the learned counsel, brought to the court's notice a typographical mistake in the order dated 28.07.2023. He clarified that the petitioner is, in fact, the complainant and the father of the victim in this case. Mr. Chaudhary argued that the situation involves a grave accusation of rape against the petitioner, citing the minimum 20-year sentence stipulated under Section 376(3) of the IPC and Section 4(2) of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012. The counsel expressed reservations regarding the perceived perfunctory issuance of a bail order by the High Court for the primary accused in this serious criminal matter.
