From my vantage point as a witness, I observed the intricate dynamics within Sandhya's matrimonial home, leading to her decision to file a police report and subsequently an FIR. The turmoil caused by living together with R1, R2, and R3 became palpable, and Sandhya's allegations of assault added a layer of complexity. The FIR, as a formal record of the criminal complaint, captured the intensity of the situation and served as a crucial document in subsequent legal actions.

Witnessing the denial of R2 and R3's appeal, asserting that women cannot be considered Respondents in Domestic Violence (DV) proceedings, raised questions about the interpretation of the law. The subsequent overturning of the order, enabling the eviction of the Appellant from her matrimonial home, showcased the evolving dynamics of legal decisions. From my perspective, this case highlighted the need for a nuanced understanding of domestic violence laws and the crucial role of witnesses in comprehending the complexities of matrimonial disputes.
