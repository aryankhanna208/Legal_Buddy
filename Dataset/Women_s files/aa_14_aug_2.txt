In the legal matter of Revinder Singh vs. State of Haryana (AIR 1975 SC 856), the Supreme Court dealt with a case involving a husband who suspected his wife of an extramarital affair. The husband, in a fit of anger, resorted to a gruesome act by throwing acid on his wife, resulting in severe burns and her subsequent death. The court convicted the husband under Section 302 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) for murder and Section 313 IPC for causing the miscarriage of a woman without her consent. The sentencing included life imprisonment and a fine of Rs. 2000. The imposition of a relatively modest fine raises concerns about the adequacy of the punitive measures for such a heinous crime.
