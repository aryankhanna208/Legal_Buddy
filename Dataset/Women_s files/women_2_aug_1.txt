The complainants, Pushpa Narottam Harsora and her daughter Kusum Narottam Harsora, filed a complaint against Pradeep, his wife, and her two sisters, alleging domestic abuse. The Respondents sought the release of Pradeep's wife and sisters, contending that the complaint could only be filed against an "adult male." This application was denied by the Metropolitan Magistrate.

The Bombay High Court's ruling clarified that Section 2(q) of the Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act should be interpreted in conjunction with the definitions in Sections 2(a), 2(f), and 2(s) of the Act. This interpretation expanded the scope to allow complaints against female family members and the "adult male member." However, the court specified that a complaint alleging domestic abuse cannot be primarily against female members, requiring a co-Respondent to be an adult male. Consequently, the term "adult male person" was not read down. Following this ruling, the mother and daughter duo filed a writ petition in the Supreme Court.
