In a shocking development in the Aluva child rape and murder case in Kerala, the court disclosed that the convicted 28-year-old, Ashfaq Alam, was implicated in a similar crime in Delhi back in 2018. The accused had allegedly fled to Kerala, preventing the Delhi case from reaching a resolution. The incident underscores the need for a more robust and coordinated system to track individuals accused of such serious offenses, preventing them from evading legal consequences and potentially perpetrating further crimes in different locations.
