Veerla Stayanarayna Vs State of A.P 2002(Supp)1 SC 489.

In a case before the Calcutta High Court1 the accused had made a previous abortive attempt to throw acid on the victim and succeeded on a second attempt. The motive for the crime was revenge as the victim had rebuffed the overtures of the main accused Ramesh. The accused along with two others went to the victims house and threw a bottle of acid on the victim outside her house where she, her mother, her aunt and her little son were sitting. The victim, her mother, her aunt and her son sustained injury.

The victim Padma died due to extensive acid burns on the neck, chest, right alna, breasts, legs, knees and scalp. Her aunt received 25% burns and her aunt's son received 11% burns. The additional sessions Judge awarded imprisonment for life and a fine for Rs. 5000 under Section 302 and 34 of the IPC. The appellants were also convicted under S. 324/34 IPC and sentenced to R.I. for one year and to pay a fine of Rs. 1,000/- each in default to suffer S.I. for two months.

Both sentences were to run concurrently. The High Court on appeal however, set aside the conviction and sentence against the other two accused by stating that there was no evidence to show they had a common intention and their presence with the accused on the scene of the crime was not enough.
