In a disturbing incident on September 16 at Sai Upvan city forest in Ghaziabad, a 22-year-old woman and her fiance faced an egregious violation of their rights as they were allegedly sexually harassed by two individuals posing as police officers and an unidentified civilian. The perpetrators, utilizing a Ghaziabad Police response vehicle, subjected the couple to hours of torment, culminating in a demand for Rs 10,000. The victim's formal complaint, filed on September 28 at the Kotwali Nagar police station, highlights the appalling actions, including physical assault, inappropriate touching, and subsequent intimidation at their residence.
