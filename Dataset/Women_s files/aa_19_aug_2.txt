In a case adjudicated before the Madras High Court, a nurse and a compounder found themselves entangled in an alleged conspiracy. Their purported act of revenge, involving the administration of a corrosive mixture to a doctor, stemmed from an accusation of sexual assault by the doctor against the nurse. Tragically, the doctor suffered fatal burn injuries, prompting legal action under Sections 302 and 109 of the IPC. However, the accused were acquitted on the grounds of insufficient evidentiary support.
