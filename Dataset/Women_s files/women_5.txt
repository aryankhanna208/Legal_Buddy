In this case, Rajesh Sharma (Appellant) and Sneha Sharma (Respondent) married on November 28th, 2012. Sneha’s father gave the dowry to the best of his ability, but the Appellants were not pleased. They began harassing or beating the Complainant and demanded Rs. 3,00,000/- in dowry and a vehicle. Since the Complainant’s pregnancy had been aborted, the Appellant had left her at her house. The wife filed a lawsuit against the Appellant and his family. She claimed that her husband demanded dowry when she was pregnant and that she was tormented by her spouse and his family members, resulting in the termination of her pregnancy.

The Appellants petitioned the High Court to have the summons cancelled, but the Court denied their request. As a result, the Appellants filed an appeal in the Supreme Court against the High Court’s decision.

The Appellants, on the other hand, had no intention of making dowry demands
