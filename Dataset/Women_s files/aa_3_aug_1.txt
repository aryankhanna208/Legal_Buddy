In the landmark case of Revinder Singh vs. State of Haryana (AIR 1975 SC 856), the Supreme Court adjudicated a distressing incident that unfolded before the Madras High Court. The accused, suspecting his wife of an extramarital affair, succumbed to a fit of anger and perpetrated a heinous act by throwing acid on her. The consequences were severe, leading to the victim's death due to the resultant burns.

The court, in its verdict, found the husband guilty under Section 302 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) for murder and Section 313 IPC for causing the miscarriage of a woman without her consent. The gravity of the offenses warranted a life imprisonment sentence for the accused. However, the accompanying fine of Rs. 2000 was deemed by some as a meager amount considering the extreme nature of the crime.

This case brings attention to the intricacies of legal sentencing and the ongoing debate about the adequacy of penalties for crimes of such magnitude. The judiciary's role in striking a balance between punitive measures and societal expectations is underscored, prompting a broader examination of legal frameworks in addressing gender-based violence.
