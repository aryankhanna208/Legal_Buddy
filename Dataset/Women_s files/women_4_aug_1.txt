From the victim's standpoint, this legal saga represents a protracted struggle against domestic abuse and injustice. Married in 1980, the deterioration of the marital bond led to the wife's expulsion from her matrimonial home in 2005, marking a dark turn in her life. Initiating legal recourse under the Domestic Violence (DV) Act became an imperative step to seek redress. The Magistrate's intervention, though offering interim relief and a protection/residence order, could not erase the emotional scars inflicted by the husband's actions. The subsequent attempt to displace her from government housing, despite the Magistrate's directive, underscores the persistent threat to her well-being. The denied appeal at the Additional Sessions court dealt a blow to her pursuit of justice, leaving her grappling with the question of the DV Act's retrospective applicability. In the victim's eyes, this dataset encapsulates not just a legal battle but a testament to resilience, seeking recognition and protection against the pervasive crime of domestic violence.
