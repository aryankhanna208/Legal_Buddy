Sonali suffered violence from both Ravi as well as her in-laws. Her mother-in-law would physically and verbally abuse her. Once, when Sonali was on the phone with her mother in India, her mother-in-law was listening to the conversation on another line. When Sonali confronted her, her mother-in-law became angry and slapped Sonali. She began to cry and called Ravi at his place of employment and he came home and took her back to his office with him.
