"I witnessed the interaction between Suresh Gopi and the journalist. I saw Gopi touch the journalist on the shoulder and make a comment about her appearance. The journalist was clearly uncomfortable and asked Gopi to stop. Gopi continued to make inappropriate comments and the journalist walked away. I believe that Gopi's behavior was inappropriate and that he should be held accountable for his actions."
