The plaintiffs in this case were a mother-daughter duo named Pushpa and Kusum Narottam Harsora. They made a complaint saying that domestic abuse was committed by Pradeep (son/brother), his wife, and her two sisters. The Respondents requested that the Metropolitan Magistrate free Pradeep's wife and two sisters/daughters. Application from the Respondents was turned down.

However, a domestic abuse complaint cannot be made exclusively against the female household members. Male adult must be a co-respondent. As a result, the Court did not define "adult male person" further. The mother and daughter duo then petitioned the Supreme Court for a writ.
