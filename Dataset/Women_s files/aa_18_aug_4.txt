One glaring omission in the aftermath of this tragic case is the absence of compensation for the victims. Acid attacks inflict not only physical but also enduring psychological and financial trauma. The failure to award compensation raises questions about the adequacy of legal mechanisms in delivering holistic justice to survivors. From a restorative justice perspective, compensating victims becomes a crucial aspect of acknowledging their suffering and aiding in their recovery. This case prompts a deeper examination of the legal framework surrounding victim compensation, calling for reforms to ensure that survivors of such heinous crimes receive the necessary support and restitution to rebuild their lives.
