Before the backdrop of the Jharkhand High Court, a legal conundrum emerged from an acid attack case. At a Dhanbad bus stop, the appellant, armed with a photograph and motivated by blackmail, poured acid on the victim's head and face. The victim's refusal to yield to extortion demands led to burn injuries on the eye, neck, and chest, prompting charges under Sections 324, 326, and 307 IPC. The 2nd Additional Sessions Judge, Dhanbad, pronounced the appellant guilty under Section 324 IPC, a decision upheld by the Hon'ble High Court. Notably, the victim received no compensation, with the court's focus seemingly guided by its evaluation of the injuries, falling short of the threshold for grievous hurt.
