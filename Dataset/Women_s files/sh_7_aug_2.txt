A horrifying incident unfolded at the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) in Banaras Hindu University (BHU) as a female student fell victim to harassment by three bike-borne men outside the campus late on Wednesday night. The assailants forcibly kissed her, stripped her, and recorded a video, prompting a strong outcry and demands for improved campus security. The student, who had ventured out to meet a friend near the Gandhi Smriti Hostel intersection, recounted in her complaint that the men silenced her, took her to an isolated spot, and subjected her to a traumatic experience before releasing her. In response, a significant protest erupted at IIT-BHU in Varanasi, urging a 'closed campus' approach for enhanced student safety and emphasizing the pressing need for stringent measures to prevent such incidents and protect the well-being of students.
