1. The petitioner seeks his enlargement on regular bail in FIR
No.098/2020 dated 18­03­2020 registered at Police Station – Mandi,
District Saharanpur, U.P. under Sections 376­D, 366 and 506 of the
Indian Penal Code (IPC), 1860. 
2. The   allegations   are   that   the   petitioner   and   his   co­accused
dragged the victim in a car, gave her an intoxicant substance and
gang­raped   her.   When   she   regained   conscious,   the   petitioner   was
2
allegedly   making   her   video   and   demanded   a   hefty   amount   with   a
threat that in the event of non­payment, the video will be uploaded
on social media. 
3. The petitioner was arrested on 22­05­2020. 
4. We   have   gone   through   the   contents   of   the   FIR,   where   the
complainant has alleged that the petitioner was known to her for a
long time and he introduced her to his mother with a promise to
marry   her.   The   complainant   also   alleges   that   the   petitioner   has
physically abused her many times on the pretext of marrying.
5. The   investigation   is   complete   and   charge­sheet   has   already
been filed.
6. During the course of hearing, we are informed that out of 16
witnesses, 1 witness has already been examined. The conclusion of
trial will thus take time. The petitioner is in custody for almost
three years.
7. In such circumstances, but without expressing any views on the
merits of the case, we are inclined to enlarge the petitioner on
bail.
8. The petitioner is, therefore, ordered to be released on bail,
subject   to   his   furnishing   bail   bonds   to   the   satisfaction   of   the
Trial Court.
9. The petitioner is directed to remain present in Trial Court on
every   date   of   hearing,   failing   which   it   will   be   construed   as   a
misuse of the concession of bail.
10. The Special Leave Petition is disposed of in the above­terms.
