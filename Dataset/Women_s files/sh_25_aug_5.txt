The tranquility of a visit to Sai Upvan city forest in Ghaziabad on September 16 was shattered for a 22-year-old woman and her fiance when they became targets of alleged sexual harassment by two individuals donning police attire and an unidentified civilian. Employing a Ghaziabad Police response vehicle, the accused coerced the couple into parting with Rs 10,000. The victim, in her complaint registered on September 28 at the Kotwali Nagar police station, detailed the distressing ordeal, including physical assault on her fiance and persistent harassment that extended to their residence.
