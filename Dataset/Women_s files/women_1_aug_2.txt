In this legal imbroglio, the complainant, distinct from the respondent's lawful consort, approached the court seeking maintenance. The appellant, entrenched in a live-in relationship, bore progeny during the course of this union. Following their separation, the appellant, faced with the onus of single parenthood, petitioned for financial sustenance from her erstwhile partner. The Gumla Family Court, adjudicating on this matter, decreed a monthly stipend of Rs 2000 for the appellant and Rs 1000 for the child. Dissatisfied with the trial court's disposition, the appellant exercised her right to appeal, invoking the jurisdiction of the High Court. However, the High Court's verdict deviated from her expectations, ruling in favor of the respondent. Undeterred, the appellant, driven by the pursuit of justice, sought recourse in the highest judicial echelon, the Supreme Court.
