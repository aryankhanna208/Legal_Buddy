Within the precincts of the Madras High Court, a compelling legal drama unfolded as a nurse and a compounder stood accused of a calculated conspiracy. Their alleged retribution, a harrowing mixture of acid and kerosene, targeted a doctor accused of sexual misconduct. The resultant 100% burn injuries led to the doctor's demise. Despite facing charges under IPC Sections 302 and 109, the accused managed to secure acquittal, citing a dearth of substantial evidence.
