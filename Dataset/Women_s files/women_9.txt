In this case, the Appellant Lata is the Respondent’s brother-in-law, i.e. his brother’s widow, and they used to live together in a Hindu Joint Family Property. According to the lawsuit filed in the Supreme Court, there seem to be no rules in the Act that requires the Appellant to pay maintenance to the Brother’s wife. Only if they were in a business partnership would he be obligated to pay the maintenance.

 The lady said that after her husband died, she was not permitted to dwell in her matrimonial house and was driven out with her kid, and she now has no means of support for herself and her child.
