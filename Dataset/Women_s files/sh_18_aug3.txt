"As I was making my way home with a friend on our two-wheeler, we suddenly found ourselves being followed by a group of men on motorcycles. Despite hearing them hurling names at us, we lacked the courage to halt or look back. Determined to escape the situation, I accelerated our two-wheeler and sped towards the main road, aiming to reach a bustling area before they could close in on us. Luckily, the men ceased their pursuit upon reaching the main road. The entire incident marked one of the most harrowing rides of our lives," she shared.
