In a tragic turn of events on Tuesday, a 16-year-old girl in Uttar Pradesh's Shamli district took her own life by consuming poison. The incident unfolded as the accused, Talib, facing allegations of sexually harassing the girl, allegedly exerted pressure on her to withdraw the case. The Jhinjhana police station, having dealt with the matter previously, took prompt action upon receiving a fresh complaint from the girl's father. Talib is now facing charges of abetment of suicide, according to Additional Superintendent of Police O P Singh.
