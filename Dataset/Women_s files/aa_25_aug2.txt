State of Uttar Pradesh v. Smt Aqueela, 1999 Cr LJ 2754.
Acid attacks have been recorded over time, categorized under sections pertaining to hurt, grievous hurt, and murder. Yet, the distinct and intricate nature of acid attack crimes surpasses the coverage of existing legal sections related to harm and grievous hurt, rendering them insufficient in providing appropriate relief and penalties. Additionally, the discretionary authority exercised by the police in selecting the applicable sections introduces the potential for gender bias, corruption, or flawed judgments.
