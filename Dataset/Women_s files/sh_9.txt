Minors targeted in 4 sexual harassment cases

A lift operator in Chennai was arrested for sexually abusing two juvenile girls at a housing complex. The man was caught by residents and handed over to the police after he abused a seven-year-old girl in the lift. The incident came to light when the girl's parents noticed her reluctance to use the lift. Further investigations revealed that the operator had also misbehaved with an eight-year-old girl. Two separate cases have been registered against the accused under the Pocso Act.
