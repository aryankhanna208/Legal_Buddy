Trapped in a web of torment and fear, a 16-year-old girl in Shamli district, Uttar Pradesh, saw no escape but to take her own life. The relentless pressure exerted by Talib, the man accused of harassing her, proved too much to bear. The Jhinjhana police station, upon receiving a fresh complaint from her father, took prompt action, charging Talib with abetment to suicide. This tragic incident serves as a stark reminder of the devastating consequences of sexual harassment and the urgent need for justice," echoed the silent plea of the victim, a voice silenced too soon.
