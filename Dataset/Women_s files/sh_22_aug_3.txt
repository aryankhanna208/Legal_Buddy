The Aluva child rape and murder case in Kerala has taken a disturbing turn with revelations about the convict, 28-year-old Ashfaq Alam. The court disclosed that Alam, found guilty in the brutal rape and murder of a 5-year-old child, was accused in a parallel case in Delhi in 2018. Shockingly, he had absconded to Kerala, preventing the conclusion of the Delhi case. This revelation raises serious questions about the efficacy of tracking and apprehending individuals accused of heinous crimes, urging the need for more effective measures to ensure swift justice and prevent such offenders from eluding legal consequences.
