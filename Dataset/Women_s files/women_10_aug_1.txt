Incident Report - Domestic Abuse Complaint

The complainants, Pushpa and Kusum Narottam Harsora, allege domestic abuse perpetrated by Pradeep (son/brother), his wife, and her sisters. Respondents sought release for Pradeep's wife and sisters, denied by the Magistrate. Notably, domestic abuse charges necessitate a male co-respondent. Court refrains from specifying "adult male person." Seeking justice, the mother-daughter duo petitions the Supreme Court for a writ.
