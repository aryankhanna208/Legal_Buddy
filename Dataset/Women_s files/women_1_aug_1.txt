The aggrieved party, not legally bound in matrimony to the respondent, initiated legal action seeking maintenance. The appellant, entangled in a cohabitation arrangement, bore offspring during this liaison. Post-separation, she petitioned for spousal support and financial assistance for the child. The Gumla Family Court granted a monthly sum of Rs 2000 for the appellant and Rs 1000 for the child. Dissatisfied, the appellant appealed to the High Court, asserting the family court's misjudgment. However, the High Court ruled in favor of the respondent, prompting the appellant to escalate the matter to the Supreme Court, seeking redress in the highest legal echelon.
