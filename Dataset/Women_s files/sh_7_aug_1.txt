In a deeply disturbing incident at the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) in Banaras Hindu University (BHU), a female student became the target of harassment by three bike-borne men outside the campus late on Wednesday night. The perpetrators, who forcibly kissed her, stripped her, and recorded a video of the appalling act, triggered a wave of outrage and demands for enhanced campus security.

The victim, a student at IIT-BHU, had left her hostel late Wednesday night to meet a friend near the Gandhi Smriti Hostel intersection. While they were together, three men on a motorcycle approached them. According to the victim's account in her complaint, the assailants forcefully silenced her, took her to a secluded area, and subjected her to a harrowing ordeal, capturing photos and videos of the assault. The assailants released her after approximately 10-15 minutes.

Following this traumatic incident, a significant protest unfolded at the IIT-BHU campus in Varanasi, Uttar Pradesh, on Thursday morning. Outraged students and supporters rallied against the shocking attack, demanding a 'closed campus' to ensure the safety and security of students.

The incident underscores the urgent need for heightened security measures within educational institutions to protect students, particularly women, from such reprehensible acts. It has ignited a broader conversation about the safety of students outside the confines of the campus and the imperative for swift and stringent legal action against the perpetrators. As the campus community unites in protest, there is a collective call for institutional reforms and a commitment to creating an environment where every student can pursue education without fear of harassment or assault.
