A harrowing incident unfolded at the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) in Banaras Hindu University (BHU) when a female student was targeted by three bike-borne men outside the campus late on Wednesday night. The assailants not only forcibly kissed her but also subjected her to the traumatic experience of being stripped, all while recording a video of the reprehensible act. This appalling incident has sparked widespread outrage, leading to a significant protest at IIT-BHU in Varanasi on Thursday morning.

According to the victim's complaint, she had left her hostel late at night to meet a friend near the Gandhi Smriti Hostel intersection. The assailants, arriving on a motorcycle, forcibly silenced her, took her to a secluded area, and carried out the disturbing assault before releasing her after approximately 10-15 minutes.

The incident has reignited the debate on campus safety, prompting demands for a 'closed campus' to ensure the well-being of students. The protest at IIT-BHU emphasizes the urgency of enhancing security measures within educational institutions and taking swift legal action against the perpetrators. The collective call for institutional reforms aims to create an environment where every student, especially women, can pursue education without fear of harassment or assault.
