A shocking incident unfolded at a Dhanbad Bus Stop, underscoring the legal nuances surrounding cases where fatality is averted. In this instance before the Jharkhand High Court1, an appellant orchestrated a targeted acid attack on a victim, who, alongside her friend, was waiting at the bus stop.

The assailant, armed with a photograph of the victim, had been using it as leverage for blackmail. When the victim refused to comply with his demands, the appellant resorted to a heinous act, pouring acid over her head and face. The repercussions were severe, as the victim suffered burns on her eye, neck, and chest, compelling her hospitalization. The police promptly registered a case under Sections 324, 326, and 307 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC).

Following an intensive investigation, the police submitted a chargesheet against the appellant, leading to his conviction under Section 324 IPC by the 2nd Additional Sessions Judge in Dhanbad. The Hon'ble High Court upheld this decision, emphasizing the gravity of the injuries as a guiding factor in the legal proceedings. Notably, the victim received no compensation, raising pertinent questions about the broader legal framework concerning grievous hurt.
