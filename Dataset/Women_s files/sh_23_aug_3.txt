I am the victim of sexual harassment by Suresh Gopi. I was interviewing Gopi when he began to make inappropriate comments about my appearance and touched me without my consent. I was very uncomfortable and asked him to stop, but he continued. I am very upset by what happened and I hope that Gopi is punished for his actions."
