State(Delhi Administration) Vs. Mewa Singh 5(1969) DLT 506.

In Syed Shafique Ahmed Vs. State of Maharashtra, 2002 Cr LJ 1403, personal enemity with his wife was the reason behind a gruesome acid attack by the husband on his wife as well as another person . This caused disfiguration of the face of both the wife as well as that of the other person and loss of vision of right eye of wife. The accused was charged under Section 326 and 324 of the IPC and was awarded Rs 5000 as fine and 3 years imprisonment. This case again shows that the punishment that is often awarded does not take into account the deliberate and gruesome nature of the attack and rests on technicalities of injuries.

In another case1 due to enmity acid was poured by a mother and son duo over the victims. One of the victim suffered from multiple acid burns on the whole back extending from scapular spine to iliac crest. The other victim suffered Chemical burns on the right side forehead just above medial end of right eye brow and the skin blackened.

He also suffered from multiple acid burn on the lateral aspect of left upper arm and skin was blackened apart from other burns. The accused were convicted under Section 304 (punishment for culpable homicide not amounting to murder) and 323/34 IPC (punishment for voluntarily causing hurt with common intention), with imprisonment of a year and rigorous imprisonment for one year.
