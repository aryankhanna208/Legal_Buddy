Within the jurisdiction of the Jharkhand High Court, a disturbing incident unfolded where the victim, standing at a bus stop with a friend in Dhanbad, became the target of an acid attack by the appellant. The assailant, armed with a photograph and driven by motives of blackmail, resorted to violence when met with refusal. The victim suffered burn injuries to the left side of her eye, neck, and chest, necessitating hospitalization. The legal response to this egregious act resulted in a case registered under Sections 324, 326, and 307 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC). The subsequent conviction by the 2nd Additional Sessions Judge, Dhanbad, under Section 324 IPC, and the upheld decision by the Hon'ble High Court did not include compensation for the victim. The court's rationale appeared to be influenced by its assessment of the injuries, deeming them insufficient to qualify as grievous hurt.
