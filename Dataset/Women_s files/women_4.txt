The parties in this case got married on 23rd August 1980 and on 4th July 2005 the Respondent(wife) was driven out of her matrimonial home.
Thereafter Respondent filed a petition to the Magistrate under Section 12 of the DV Act.
The Magistrate granted interim relief of Rs 6000 to the wife  and subsequently passed a protection/residence order under Section 18 and 19 of the DV Act protecting the right of The Respondent wife to reside in her matrimonial home in Mathura.
Meanwhile, the husband, who served in the armed forces, retired and filed an application to remove his wife from the government housing.
Taking this into account, the Magistrate directed the petitioner to enable his wife to reside on the first floor of her marital house or, if that is not practicable, to find alternative lodging close to her matrimonial home or to pay Rs 10,000 in rental costs.
She preferred an appeal since she was dissatisfied with the Magistrate’s decision.
The appeal was denied, and the Additional Sessions court reasoned that “because the applicant left the married house on 4.7.2005 and the Act came into effect on 26.10.2006, the claim of a woman living in a domestic relationship or residing together prior to 26.10.2006 was not maintainable.”
The HC investigated this legal issue in response to an appeal. and it directed that the action be maintained even though it was taken prior to the Act’s coming into effect.
