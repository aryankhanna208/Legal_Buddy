In this case, Arnesh Kumar (Appellant) and Sweta Kiran (Respondent) were married on July 1, 2007. Sweta Kiran claimed in Court that her mother-in-law and father-in-law sought Rs. 8 lakhs, a Maruti car, an air conditioner, a television set, and other items, and that when this was brought to Arnesh Kumarâ€™s attention, he backed his mother and threatened to marry another woman. She further claimed that she was evicted from her matrimonial house since the dowry demand was not met. Arnesh Kumar refuted the charges and filed an anticipatory bail plea, which was initially dismissed by the learned Sessions Judge and then by the High Court. As a result, Arnesh Kumar has filed a Special Leave Petition with the Supreme Court.
