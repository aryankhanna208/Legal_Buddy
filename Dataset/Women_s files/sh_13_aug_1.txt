Mr. Ansar Ahmad Chaudhary, the learned counsel, has brought to the court's attention a typographical error in the order dated 28.07.2023, stating that the petitioner is, in fact, the complainant and the father of the victim. He emphasizes the gravity of the case involving the alleged rape of a 14-year-old girl by the petitioner. Noting the minimum 20-year sentence prescribed for convictions under Section 376(3) of the IPC and Section 4(2) of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012, the counsel contends that the High Court's issuance of a bail order for the main accused in a seemingly perfunctory manner is inappropriate.
