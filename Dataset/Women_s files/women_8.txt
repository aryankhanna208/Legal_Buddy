In this case, the petitioner Kamlesh Devi stated that she and the Respondents are family members of the same family and they’ve been residing in the same premises for a long time. The petitioner’s husband is a former BSF officer, and she has three kids, Urmila, Anusaya, and Gaytri. Anusaya and Gaytri are the petitioner’s unmarried daughters who attend Krishna Nagar College for their education. Furthermore, Respondents have formed a gang and are quarrelsome individuals, and whenever the Petitioner’s daughters, Anusaya and Gaytri, went to their college, Respondents Jaipal, Krishan Kumar, and Sandeep followed them and taunted them, as well as engaged them in obscene behaviour.

Sube Singh, the petitioner’s husband, also filed a complaint with the Sarpanch of Village Gaud against the Respondents, after which the Respondents apologised in writing on 5.8.2008 in the presence of respected members of the village. They then returned to normalcy for a short period of time before resuming their obscene behaviour. As a result, having exhausted all other options for protection from domestic abuse, the complaint was filed.

After examining the provisions of the Act, the Trial Court determined that none of the witnesses on record demonstrated any fact to the effect that the Respondents and the petitioner were living in a shared home and that the Respondents had committed domestic violence against them.

The trial court also ruled that no violence of any sort was claimed within the joint household’s grounds. The case was dismissed by the Ld. Magistrate. An appeal filed with the High Court was likewise rejected.
