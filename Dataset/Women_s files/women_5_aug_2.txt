Legal Battle Unfolds: Dowry Harassment Allegations Reach Supreme Court

The marital union of Rajesh Sharma (Appellant) and Sneha Sharma (Respondent), forged on November 28th, 2012, takes a legal turn. Allegations arise that despite the dowry bestowed by Sneha's father, the Appellants subjected her to harassment, demanding Rs. 3,00,000/- and a vehicle. A distressing narrative unfolds as the Complainant's pregnancy is aborted, leading to her abandonment by the Appellant. In response, a legal battle ensues, with the wife filing a lawsuit detailing dowry harassment and pregnancy-related torment.

The High Court denies the Appellants' plea to annul the summons, prompting them to escalate the matter to the Supreme Court through an appeal. Intriguingly, the Appellants assert no prior intention to make dowry demands, adding a layer of complexity to the evolving legal saga.
