Unsafe: Girl molested, flasher targets woman
CHENNAI: In two separate incidents  of sexual harassment
In the first incident, a software engineer employed with a multinational company in Taramani was on her way to the Marundeeshwarar Temple in Thiruvanmiyur when a stranger intercepted her near Iyyappan Cross Street in Perungudi.
He exposed himself to her and made sexual gestures while she was walking alone on the street. The woman ignored him and tried to rush back home. However, the stranger followed her and threw a ‘sticky liquid’ on her. Traumatised and scared, she returned home and informed her mother about the incident. The older woman and other family members then travelled to the Thoraipakkam police and submitted a petition.
Based on the complaint, the Thoraipakkam police registered a case. Police are scanning the footage from the various CCTV cameras in the vicinity to trace the perpetrator, but are yet to make any arrests in this connection.
