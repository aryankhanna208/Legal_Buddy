State of Uttar Pradesh v. Smt Aqueela, 1999 Cr LJ 2754.
Throughout the years, various acid attacks have been officially registered, falling within legal sections addressing harm, grievous harm, and even murder. Nevertheless, the unique and intricate nature of acid attack crimes exceeds the scope of existing sections related to harm and grievous harm, resulting in inadequate relief and penalties. Compounding the issue, law enforcement often exercises discretionary powers, leading to potential gender bias, corruption, or inaccurate assessments in determining the appropriate legal sections.
