Incident Report - Alleged Harassment

Kamlesh Devi, the petitioner, alleges persistent harassment by family members, the Respondents. As a former BSF officer's wife with three children, including unmarried daughters attending Krishna Nagar College, the petitioner contends that the Respondents, Jaipal, Krishan Kumar, and Sandeep, form a troublesome gang. Despite a previous apology, obscene behavior persists. A complaint, citing domestic abuse, was filed after exhausting alternative remedies. The Trial Court and subsequent High Court appeal found insufficient evidence of shared living or domestic violence, leading to the case's dismissal.
