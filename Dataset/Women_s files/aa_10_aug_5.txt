In the annals of the Jharkhand High Court, a legal saga unfolded where an acid attack marred the tranquility of a Dhanbad bus stop. The appellant, armed with a photograph and harboring blackmail motives, inflicted acid burns on the victim who refused compliance. The ensuing legal proceedings saw charges filed under Sections 324, 326, and 307 IPC. The 2nd Additional Sessions Judge, Dhanbad, rendered a verdict of guilt under Section 324 IPC, a decision ratified by the Hon'ble High Court. Notably, the victim received no compensation, with the court's perspective seemingly influenced by its assessment of the injuries, deeming them below the threshold for grievous hurt.
