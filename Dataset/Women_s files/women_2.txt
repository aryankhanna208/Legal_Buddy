In this case, The plaintiffs were Pushpa Narottam Harsora and Kusum Narottam Harsora, a mother-daughter duo. They filed a complaint against Pradeep (son/brother), his wife, and her two sisters, alleging that the four of them subjected them to domestic abuse.   The Respondents urged the Metropolitan Magistrate to release Pradeep’s wife and two sisters/daughters since a complaint may only be filed against an “adult male.” The Respondents’ application was denied.

The Bombay High Court ruled that Section 2(q) of the aforementioned Act should be read in light of the definitions contained in Sections 2(a), 2(f), and 2(s) of the Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act. Essentially, this assured that a complaint could be lodged against female family members as well as the “adult male member.” However, a complaint alleging domestic abuse cannot be brought primarily against the female members of the household. A co-Respondent must be an adult male. As a result, the Court did not read down the term “adult male person.” After this the mother and daughter duo filed a writ petition in the Supreme Court.
