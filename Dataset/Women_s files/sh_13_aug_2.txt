In a recent legal development, Mr. Ansar Ahmad Chaudhary, the counsel representing the petitioner, highlighted a typographical error in the court order dated 28.07.2023. It was clarified that the petitioner is, in fact, the complainant and the father of the victim. Mr. Chaudhary argued that the case involves a serious accusation of rape against the petitioner, emphasizing the minimum 20-year sentence prescribed for such offenses under Section 376(3) of the IPC and Section 4(2) of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012. He expressed concern over the High Court's seemingly perfunctory issuance of a bail order for the primary accused.
