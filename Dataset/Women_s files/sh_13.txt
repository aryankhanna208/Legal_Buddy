The counsel submits that this is a serious case of
rape of a 14 year old girl by the petitioner and
considering that minimum sentence of 20 years
prescribed for conviction under Section 376(3) of IPC
and Section 4(2) of the Protection of Children from
Sexual Offences Act, 2012, the High Court should not
have perfunctorily issued the bail order for the main
accused in the case.
