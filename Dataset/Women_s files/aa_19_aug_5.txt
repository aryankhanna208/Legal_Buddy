The intricate tapestry of legal proceedings unfolded within the Madras High Court in a case involving a nurse, a compounder, and a doctor. A mosaic of revenge, triggered by an alleged rape, played out as acid and kerosene meted out justice in the form of 100% burn injuries and the doctor's subsequent demise. Amidst the legal mosaic, the accused faced the formidable IPC Sections 302 and 109, only to emerge from the courtroom with an acquittal, the canvas of evidence deemed insufficient in the eyes of the law.
