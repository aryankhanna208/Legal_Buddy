Pushpa Narottam Harsora and her daughter Kusum Narottam Harsora filed a complaint against Pradeep, his wife, and her two sisters, accusing them of domestic abuse. The Respondents, seeking the release of Pradeep's wife and sisters, argued that a complaint could only be filed against an "adult male." The Metropolitan Magistrate rejected this application.

The Bombay High Court's ruling clarified the interpretation of Section 2(q) of the Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act in light of Sections 2(a), 2(f), and 2(s). This clarification allowed complaints against female family members along with the "adult male member." However, the court emphasized that a complaint alleging domestic abuse must not primarily target female members, requiring a co-Respondent to be an adult male. The court upheld the term "adult male person" without reading it down. Subsequently, the mother-daughter duo approached the Supreme Court by filing a writ petition.
