In a preceding case presented before the Madras High Court, a nurse and a compounder were alleged to have conspired, orchestrating an act of vengeance against a doctor. Their purported retaliation involved pouring a concoction of acid and kerosene over the doctor, purportedly in response to an alleged rape of the nurse by the doctor. The doctor tragically suffered 100% burn injuries, ultimately leading to his demise. Despite facing charges under Sections 302 (murder) and 109 (abetment) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC), the accused were ultimately exonerated due to a discerned insufficiency of evidence.
