After getting married in 2005, the Appellant Sandhya lived with R1, R2, and R3 for nearly a year, which caused problems in her marriage. She filed a police report against her husband for assaulting her. She also filed an application against all three Respondents, which the First Class Judicial Magistrate granted, directing R1 to pay the monthly maintenance. All Respondents were also barred from trying to evict the Complainant from her matrimonial home. Criminal appeals and applications filed by R1 before the Sessions Judge and the High Court were denied. R2 and R3 applied to the First Class Magistrate, but their request was denied. They filed an appeal, claiming that women cannot be considered Respondents in DV proceedings. The Court agreed and overturned the order, enabling Appellant to be evicted from her marriage home, which was solely owned by R2. As a result, it was not a “shared house.” However, the Court compelled R1 to offer separate lodging or make further payment for it as an alternative. The Appellant’s appeal in Sessions Court was replied based on the decision that “females” are not included within ‘Respondents.

The HC similarly took a similar stance, deleting R2 and R3’s names from the proceedings and ordering the Appellant to quit the matrimonial home. Hence this appeal was made.
