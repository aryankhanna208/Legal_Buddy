The legal precedent set by Revinder Singh vs. State of Haryana (AIR 1975 SC 856) brought to light a tragic incident adjudicated before the Madras High Court. The accused, fueled by suspicions of his wife's alleged extramarital involvement, committed a reprehensible act by throwing acid on her, resulting in severe burns and, ultimately, her death.

The Supreme Court, in its ruling, found the husband guilty under Section 302 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) for murder and Section 313 IPC for causing the miscarriage of a woman without her consent. The court handed down a life imprisonment sentence along with a fine of Rs. 2000. However, the relatively modest fine sparked discussions about its adequacy in reflecting the gravity of the offense.

This case underscores the complex interplay between legal sanctions and societal expectations in addressing gender-based violence, raising pertinent questions about the effectiveness of current legal frameworks in ensuring justice for victims and deterrence for potential offenders.
