State of Karnataka by Jalahalli Police Station vs. Joseph Rodrigues S/o V.Z. Rodrigues (Decided in the Hon'ble High Court of Kerala on 22/8/2006).

This was a landmark case as it was the first time that a compensation which was quite a large sum was given to the victim to meet the medical expenses including that of plastic surgeries. However, no compensation was awarded for the after effects of the attack such as loss of income etc.

In a case from Delhi1 the accused threw acid on the victims face. The liquid splashed or her face produced some redness (erythema) on the skin over a part of her face involving her upper eye-lids. There was no corrosion, of the skin or other deformity. The accused was convicted for causing hurt under Section 323 of the IPC and a meager fine of Rs. 300 along with 15 days imprisonment was awarded. This sort of punishment for acid attack is in itself a mockery of sorts and does not take into consideration the gravity of the crime and its after effects like trauma which affects the victim throughout her life.
