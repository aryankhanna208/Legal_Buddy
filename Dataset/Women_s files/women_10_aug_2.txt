Breaking News: Landmark Domestic Abuse Case Heads to Supreme Court

In a groundbreaking legal battle, Pushpa and Kusum Narottam Harsora, a mother-daughter duo, have filed a complaint alleging domestic abuse against Pradeep (son/brother), his wife, and her sisters. The Metropolitan Magistrate rejected the respondents' plea to release Pradeep's wife and sisters. Notably, the court's refusal hinges on the requirement for a male co-respondent in domestic abuse cases, leaving the term "adult male person" undefined. Undeterred, the Harsoras escalate the matter to the Supreme Court, seeking a writ to address this pivotal legal ambiguity and ensure justice prevails.
