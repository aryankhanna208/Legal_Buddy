The complainants, Pushpa Narottam Harsora and Kusum Narottam Harsora, lodged a complaint against Pradeep, his wife, and her two sisters, alleging domestic abuse. The Respondents sought the release of Pradeep's wife and sisters, arguing that a complaint was only admissible against an "adult male." This plea was dismissed by the Metropolitan Magistrate.

The Bombay High Court's ruling brought clarity to the interpretation of Section 2(q) of the Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act by aligning it with Sections 2(a), 2(f), and 2(s). This clarification expanded the purview to enable complaints against both female family members and the "adult male member." However, the court emphasized that a complaint alleging domestic abuse must not primarily target female members, necessitating a co-Respondent to be an adult male. The court upheld the term "adult male person" without reading it down. Subsequently, the mother-daughter duo pursued legal recourse by filing a writ petition in the Supreme Court.
