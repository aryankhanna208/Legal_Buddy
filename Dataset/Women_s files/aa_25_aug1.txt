State of Uttar Pradesh v. Smt Aqueela, 1999 Cr LJ 2754.
Various acid attacks have been documented over the years, falling under legal sections related to harm, grievous harm, and even murder. However, the unique and intricate nature of acid attacks demands a more nuanced approach, as the existing sections concerning harm and grievous harm fail to offer adequate redress and punishment. Moreover, the discretionary powers wielded by the police in determining the applicable legal sections often lead to biased decisions influenced by gender and corruption, resulting in inaccurate assessments.
