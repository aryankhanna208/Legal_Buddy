September 16 marked a distressing encounter for a young couple visiting the Sai Upvan city forest in Ghaziabad. Two individuals, ostensibly members of the police force, accompanied by a civilian, exploited their authority to engage in hours-long sexual harassment. Demanding an exorbitant Rs 10,000, the perpetrators, using a Ghaziabad Police response vehicle, subjected the victims to unlawful coercion. The victim's subsequent complaint, filed on September 28 at the Kotwali Nagar police station, sheds light on the traumatic incidents, including physical assault and unwarranted intrusion into her home.
