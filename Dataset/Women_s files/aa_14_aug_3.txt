In the legal precedent of Revinder Singh vs. State of Haryana (AIR 1975 SC 856), the Supreme Court deliberated on a case where a husband, suspecting his wife's involvement in an extramarital relationship, committed a gruesome act by throwing acid on her. The victim suffered severe burns leading to her demise. The court found the husband guilty under Section 302 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) for murder and Section 313 IPC for causing the miscarriage of a woman without her consent. The consequential sentence included life imprisonment and a fine of Rs. 2000. The modest amount of the fine underscores the need for a critical examination of the adequacy of penalties associated with such egregious offenses.
