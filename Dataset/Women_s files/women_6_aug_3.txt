A formal police complaint has been lodged by the family of Sweta Kiran, detailing a distressing narrative of alleged dowry harassment and marital discord involving Arnesh Kumar, the appellant. According to the complaint, Arnesh Kumar's parents demanded an exorbitant dowry, including Rs. 8 lakhs, a car, an air conditioner, a television set, and other items during the marriage in 2007. Sweta Kiran contends that she was evicted from her matrimonial home when the dowry demands went unmet, further alleging that Arnesh Kumar threatened to marry another woman, backing his parents in the process. The family asserts that the dismissal of Arnesh Kumar's anticipatory bail plea by both the Sessions Judge and the High Court is indicative of the severity of the alleged crimes. The complaint emphasizes the need for legal intervention to protect the rights and dignity of married women and urges a thorough investigation into the matter.
