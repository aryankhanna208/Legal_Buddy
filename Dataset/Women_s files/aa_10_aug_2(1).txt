In the corridors of the Jharkhand High Court, a case brought attention to the complex intersection of hurt-related sections in criminal law. The victim, standing at a bus stop in Dhanbad, found herself subjected to an acid attack by the appellant, who wielded a photograph as a tool of blackmail. Refusal to comply with the appellant's demands triggered the assault, resulting in burn injuries to the victim's eye, neck, and chest. The legal fallout saw charges filed under Sections 324, 326, and 307 IPC. The appellant's conviction under Section 324 IPC by the 2nd Additional Sessions Judge, Dhanbad, and subsequent endorsement by the Hon'ble High Court lacked compensation for the victim. The court's decision appeared to hinge on its interpretation of the injuries, deeming them falling short of the threshold for grievous hurt.
