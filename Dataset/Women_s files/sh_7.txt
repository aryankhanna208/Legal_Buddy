A massive protest was held at the Indian Institute of Technology-BHU in Uttar Pradesh’s Varanasi on Thursday morning after a woman student institute was harassed outside the college campus by unknown bike-borne men late Wednesday night, who forcibly kissed her, stripped her and also recorded a video.
In her complaint, the woman said that she came out of her hostel late Wednesday night to meet a friend near the Gandhi Smriti Hostel intersection. Both of them were going together when three men came on a motorcycle and approached them, said police. “They shut my mouth tightly and took me to a corner, kissed me forcibly, and took off all my clothes, and recorded photos and videos. They let me go after 10-15 minutes,” sh_7
